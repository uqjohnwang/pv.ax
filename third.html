          <p>But in fact, when you want to circumvent government regulation,<br> there are more organizations trying to get your personal privacy, <br>because in their logic, behind the behavior of trying to evade government regulation, <br>it may be the gray industry, and this kind of business is easier to earn money for them.
<br>
<br>
The government does not only supervise citizens' privacy.<br> The government also regulates citizens' privacy while also enacting laws to protect citizens' privacy. <br>In most government supervision systems, there has been continuous efforts to prevent privacy leakage.
<br>
<br>
At the same time, the government's supervision of citizens' online behavior can also prevent crimes of stealing citizens' privacy.
<br>
<br>
As a consequence, we need to pay efforts on resolving conflicts between regulated dissatisfaction and potential risks of lack of supervision.</p>
